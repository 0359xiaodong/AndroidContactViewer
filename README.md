##The Problem

People today have lots of email address and phone numbers. Its useful to have all this information on file in a mobile application, but cumbersome to have to remember the best email or phone number to use.

##The Solution

Our contact viewer app will allow the user to manage infinate email address and phone numbers for any contact. One email address will be marked as a default for emailing, as well as a default phone for text messages, and a default phone for traditional voice calling. These defaults will be available for easy access when a user selects a contact. The user can also drill into the contact to call any number, or email and address on file for the contact.

##Contact List Screen

The contact list screen will be a simple scrollable table view showing the contacts name, company, and picture. A search bar will allow filtering the list to find a contact more easily. There is also a button in the title bar to add a new contact.

##Launch Screen

When the user taps a contacts row a launch screen will appear with buttons to call, text message or email the contact. There will also be a profile button that allows the user to view the full user profile.

##Profile Screen

The profile screen allows the user to see all of the user details and to initiate a text message, phone call, or email to any of the contacts numbers / email address. It also offers an edit button that allows the user to edit the contacts profile.

##Edit Contact Screen

The edit profile screen allows the user to add and remove phone numbers and email address. It also has a message bubble icon and a phone icon next to each of the phone numbers. Only one of each icon can be highlighted for all of a users phone numbers. The number with the highlighted icon will be used for text messaging or phone calls from the launch screen. Each email has an email icon, only one of which can be highlighted for all of a contacts email addresses. The email with the highlighted icon will be used when sending email from the launch screen.
